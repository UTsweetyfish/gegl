Description: Generic Graphics Library Test Program
 GEGL (Generic Graphics Library) is a graph based image processing
 framework.
 .
 GEGL's original design was made to scratch GIMP's itches for a new
 compositing and processing core. This core is being designed to have
 minimal dependencies and a simple well defined API.
 .
 This package contains a bunch of test programs.
